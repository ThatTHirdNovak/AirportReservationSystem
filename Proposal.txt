Data Structures 244-001: Challenge Project II: Airport System
By Alex Novak and Kai Ahrens



The Airport Reservation System project aims to develop a comprehensive system that streamlines the flight reservation process for passengers. 
This system will allow travelers to make reservations across international, national, and local airports. Passengers can perform critical 
actions such as creating, modifying, and canceling reservations. To ensure a seamless experience, the system will enforce reservation rules, 
including seat availability and flight compatibility. It will also effectively manage airport data, covering flight details, reservations, 
and passenger information.

To efficiently manage the project, the following standard library containers and algorithms will be utilized:

Maps and Multimaps: These data structures will play a pivotal role in organizing and sorting airports. Maps will store airport data, 
while multimaps will facilitate alphabetical sorting of airports by name and seat availability by number. This arrangement provides 
efficient data retrieval and sorting capabilities, enhancing the user experience.

Binary Search Algorithms: Binary search will be implemented to optimize specific operations within the system. This algorithm will notably 
accelerate the process of locating flight information and reservations. It contributes to the system's performance by expediting critical tasks.
